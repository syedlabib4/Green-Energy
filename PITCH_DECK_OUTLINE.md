## 🎬 Demo Script

**Opening (30 sec):**
"Good morning! I'm [Name] from [Team]. We're presenting EcoVolt 🌱—a solution to Pakistan's energy crisis. Did you know the average Pakistani household spends 15-20% of their income on electricity? And faces 8-12 hours of load shedding daily?"

**Problem (30 sec):**
"Load shedding alone costs households Rs 31,000/month in backup power and productivity losses. Combined with high bills and rising carbon emissions, Pakistan needs a comprehensive solution."

**Demo (2 min):**
"Let me show you how EcoVolt 🌱 works. [Open app]

First, here's our Load Shedding Impact Calculator. For a household using 500 kWh/month with 2 hours of daily load shedding, they lose Rs 31,000/month. This is money that could go toward solar investment.

Next, our Bill Reader feature. [Upload sample K-Electric bill] Using OCR, we extract consumption data automatically. No manual entry needed.

Now, our Solar Suitability Checker. For Karachi with a 100m² roof, we calculate a 15 kW system with 4.4 years payback. Monthly savings: Rs 128,000.

Finally, our AI Advisor. [Type: 'How can I reduce my bill?'] The AI provides personalized recommendations based on your specific appliances and usage patterns."

**Impact (30 sec):**
